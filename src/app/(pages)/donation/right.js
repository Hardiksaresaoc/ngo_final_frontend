            “It was a chance encounter in May 2016 with retired Army men,
            war-disabled soldiers and war-widows at Jantar Mantar. There was a
            70+ years old retired Sepoy who had a large family to support with
            his meagre pension. Both of his sons worked as daily labourers with
            no predictable income to feed their kids.
